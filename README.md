# Purpose
There is no real purpose to this project.

There are two characters, Joshua and Walt. The two of them play
an extrememly simple game, where they each draw a number between 1-10,
and whoever has the larger number wins the round. It's a best 2 out of
three scenario.

What is amusing about this is I have these two playing this game every
minute of every day on my Raspberry Pi, and so they will tirelessly play 
this game 31,536,000 times per year. If the game were to develop any hard
skills within them, they would be absolute masters of their craft in no
time. However, they are not gaining any skills through playing the game.

Now that I say this, that is a bit sad. Maybe I should give them some sort
of benefit for playing the game so much.
