#Purpose
There is no real purpose to this project.

There are two characters, Joshua and Walt. The two of them play
an extrememly simple game, where they each draw a number between 1-10,
and whoever has the larger number wins the round. It's a best 2 out of
three scenario.

What is amusing about this is I have these two playing this game every
minute of every day on my Raspberry Pi.
